# CPSC 335 Project 1
  
  **Overview**: Implementation of Project 1 for CPSC-335, which uses a doubly linked list to sort out all dark disks to the left and all light disks to the right by interchanging two neighboring disks, and a scheduling array to find availabilities.

## Execution:

   Algorithm 1 program takes input from file `DiskInput.txt` and outputs into file `DiskOutput.txt`.

   * **Linux**: Type `./a.out` into console from the appropriate directory.
   * **Windows**: Run `a.exe`, however, the necessary C++ std libraries must be installed. This method is not recommended.
